# traverse-flashcard-helper

TamperMonkey script for Traverse Mandarin learning.

Intended to be used with https://traverse.link/app alongside the [Mandarin Blueprint course](https://www.mandarinblueprint.com/). 

Currently the script saves all information about your actors, sets, and props in a local database of TamperMonkey. You can use the built-in TamperMonkey backup and sync functionality (open the "Utilities" tab and use the various file or cloud options) to sync this between devices if desired, but currently there is no "merge" functionality so each backup and restore will override any local changes.
